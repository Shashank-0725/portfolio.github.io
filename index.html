                    With rapid urbanization, more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, and this percentage is expected to grow significantly. Cities drive economic growth and innovation but also face challenges like overpopulation, pollution, inequality, and inefficient infrastructure. SDG 11 aims to ensure that cities are equipped to provide a high quality of life while being environmentally sustainable.
                    


                    <p class="insidesdg">Key Targets of SDG 11:</p>
                    1)Affordable Housing:

                    Ensure access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services for all by 2030.
                    Focus on reducing the growth of informal settlements or slums.
