                    <p class="sdg">Optimizing Tourist Routes Using Shortest Path Algorithms</p> <br>
                    <p class="insidesdg">Context:</p>Tourists visiting a city often face challenges in efficiently navigating between multiple destinations due to limited time, budget, and transportation constraints. They require a system to identify the most optimal route that minimizes travel distance or time while ensuring they can visit as many attractions as possible within their constraints.
                    <p class="insidesdg">Problem Statement:</p>
                    Given the list of tourist destinations within the city along with route distances and a sources destination. We need to find the shortest path between destinations or to find the nearest tourist destination.
                    


                    <p class="insidesdg">Possible solution:</p>
                    Here we can use graph algorithms in order to find the shortest path. There are several graph algorithms
                    <br>1) Bellman ford Algorithm: Generally bellman-ford algorithm is used when there is a negative cycle within the graph and has time complexity of O(n^2). But in this case there are no negative cycles, therefore we are not using bellman-ford algorithm.
                    
                    <br>2)Floyd Algorithm: This algorithm is used when we need to find the shortest distance between each and every node/destination and has a time complexity of O(n^3). But in our case we need to find shortest path only from source node. Therefore we are not using Floyd algorithm.
                    
                    <br>3)Dijkstra's Algorithm: This algorithm is used to used to find shortest distance between one souce to all destinations and has time complexity of O(n*log n) and is suitable for our case. Therefore we use Dijkstra's Algorithm.

                    The city has 5 attractions: A, B, C, D, E. The road distances (in kilometers) between attractions are as follows: <br>
                    
                    1. A → B: 10 km <br>
