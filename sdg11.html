                    <p class="insidesdg">Context:</p> In a growing urban environment, real estate prices fluctuate widely across neighborhoods. Citizens and urban planners need an efficient way to identify affordable housing options and high-value areas to make suitable decisions.
                    <p class="insidesdg">Problem Statement:</p>
                    Given the list of properties within the city along with prices, area and house number. We need to sort all the properties in ascending order in order to find affordable property.
                    


                    <p class="insidesdg">Possible solution:</p>
                    Here we can use Sorting algorithms in order to sort all the buildings or houses according to price. <br>
                    There are plenty of sorting algorithms that can be used in order to find the houses, But here i used Merge sort as
                    <br>1)as the number of buildings, apartments, houses are very huge therefore merge can be used as it is provides stability on huge data.
                    <br>2)as time complexity of merge sort is n(log n) which makes it highly efficient for this task.
