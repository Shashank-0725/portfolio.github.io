                    <p class="sdg">Using Sorting Algorithms for Affordable Housing Analysis</p> <br>
                    <p class="insidesdg">Context:</p> In a growing urban environment, real estate prices fluctuate widely across neighborhoods. Citizens and urban planners need an efficient way to identify affordable housing options and high-value areas to make suitable decisions.
                    <p class="insidesdg">Problem Statement:</p>
                    Given the list of properties within the city along with prices, area and house number. We need to sort all the properties in ascending order in order to find affordable property.
                    


                    <p class="insidesdg">Possible solution:</p>
                    Here we can use Sorting algorithms in order to sort all the buildings or houses according to price. <br>
                    There are plenty of sorting algorithms that can be used in order to find the houses, But here i used Merge sort as
                    <br>1)as the number of buildings, apartments, houses are very huge therefore merge can be used as it is provides stability on huge data.
                    <br>2)as time complexity of merge sort is n(log n) which makes it highly efficient for this task.


                    <br>

  
                    <p class="sdg">Example</p> <br>
                    Scenario: <br>

A real estate agent has the following house prices (in lakhs of ₹): <br>
₹25,00,000, ₹10,00,000, ₹30,00,000, ₹15,00,000, ₹40,00,000 <br>

The agent wants to: <br>

1. Sort the prices in descending order to identify premium houses. <br>


2. Sort the prices in ascending order to identify affordable houses. <br>

Explanation <br>

Steps of Merge Sort: <br>

1. Divide:
Split the array into two halves recursively until each subarray has one element (which is inherently sorted). <br>


2. Conquer:
Sort the smaller subarrays by merging them. <br>


3. Combine (Merge):
Merge the sorted subarrays to form a single sorted array. <br>

Output: <br>

House prices in descending order (₹): <br>
₹40 lakh <br>
₹30 lakh <br>
₹25 lakh <br>
₹15 lakh <br>
₹10 lakh <br>

House prices in ascending order (₹): <br>
₹10 lakh <br>
₹15 lakh <br>
₹25 lakh <br>
₹30 lakh <br>
₹40 lakh <br>


                    
<p class="sdg">Other approach is Quick sort</p> <br>

Steps of Quick Sort: 

1. Choose a Pivot: <br>

A pivot element is chosen (usually the first, last, or a random element in the array). <br>



2. Partition: <br>

Rearrange the array so that: <br>

All elements smaller than the pivot are on its left. <br>

All elements greater than the pivot are on its right. <br>




3. Recursively Apply Quick Sort: <br>

The left and right subarrays are recursively sorted. <br>

Example): <br>

Input Array: 

[40, 10, 30, 20] <br>

Step 1: Choose Pivot <br>

Choose the last element as the pivot: 20. <br>

Step 2: Partition <br>

Rearrange the array around the pivot: <br>

[10, 20, 30, 40] <br>

Here: <br>

10 is smaller than 20 (pivot), so it is on the left. <br>

30 and 40 are greater than 20, so they are on the right. <br>


Step 3: Recursively Apply Quick Sort <br>

Apply the same process to the left [10] and right [30, 40] subarrays: <br>

Left: [10] (already sorted) <br>
Right: [30, 40] → Pivot: 40 → [30, 40] (sorted) <br>

Input Prices: <br>
₹25,00,000, ₹10,00,000, ₹30,00,000, ₹15,00,000, ₹40,00,000 <br>




Output: <br>

Original house prices (in ₹): <br>
₹25 lakh ₹10 lakh ₹30 lakh ₹15 lakh ₹40 lakh  <br>

House prices sorted in ascending order (in ₹): <br>
₹10 lakh ₹15 lakh ₹25 lakh ₹30 lakh ₹40 lakh <br>
